Handle auth consent failures, insufficient scopes, mailbox not found, message not found, invalid recipient, attachment size, quota/rate limits, conflict, and provider outage errors.

On authentication, authorization, validation, conflict, quota, throttling, provider outage, or partial-write failures: stop, summarize the safe provider error, preserve object ids, and do not retry side-effecting writes blindly.
