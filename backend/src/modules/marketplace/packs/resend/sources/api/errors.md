Handle validation errors for from/to/subject/content, authentication errors, domain verification failures, rate limits, recipient suppression/bounce issues, and provider outages. Stop before sending if domain or recipient validation fails.

On authentication, authorization, validation, conflict, quota, throttling, provider outage, or partial-write failures: stop, summarize the safe provider error, preserve object ids, and do not retry side-effecting writes blindly.
