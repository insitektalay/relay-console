Expect PostgREST errors, Postgres constraint/RLS failures, JWT/auth failures, storage 404/409 errors, function invocation errors, project quota/resource issues, and 429 throttling. Treat RLS denial as a safety boundary.

On authentication, authorization, validation, conflict, quota, throttling, provider outage, or partial-write failures: stop, summarize the safe provider error, preserve object ids, and do not retry side-effecting writes blindly.
