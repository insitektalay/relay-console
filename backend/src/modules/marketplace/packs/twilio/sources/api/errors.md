Twilio returns HTTP errors and Twilio error codes for invalid numbers, unreachable destinations, blocked content, unverified trial recipients, insufficient funds, compliance failures, and rate limits. Surface code and safe explanation.

On authentication, authorization, validation, conflict, quota, throttling, provider outage, or partial-write failures: stop, summarize the safe provider error, preserve object ids, and do not retry side-effecting writes blindly.
