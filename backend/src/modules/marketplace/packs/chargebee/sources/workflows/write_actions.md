## Pack Doctrine

- Operate only against a Chargebee test or live site API connection.
- Verify environment, provider object IDs, selected capabilities, and approval profile before writes.
- Prefer read and draft workflows until a concrete approval exists for side effects.
- Redact secrets, full tokens, webhook secrets, raw payment data, and unnecessary customer billing details.
- Record provider ids, request purpose, approval id, and safe response summaries after approved writes.

## Approval-Required Writes

- Create/send/collect invoices or create hosted checkout/payment pages.
- Refund payments, issue credit notes, write off/void invoices, or apply credits.
- Create/update/cancel/pause/resume/reactivate subscriptions or change item prices/plans/coupons.
- Create/update webhook settings, export customer billing data, or change entitlement-affecting subscription items.

## Execution Checklist

1. Read the current provider object.
2. Prepare the exact request payload and expected customer/business effect.
3. Confirm approval id and environment.
4. Execute once; then re-read state and summarize safe response fields.
