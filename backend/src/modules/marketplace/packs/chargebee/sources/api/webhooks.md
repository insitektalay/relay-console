## Pack Doctrine

- Operate only against a Chargebee test or live site API connection.
- Verify environment, provider object IDs, selected capabilities, and approval profile before writes.
- Prefer read and draft workflows until a concrete approval exists for side effects.
- Redact secrets, full tokens, webhook secrets, raw payment data, and unnecessary customer billing details.
- Record provider ids, request purpose, approval id, and safe response summaries after approved writes.

## Event Families

## Webhook Doctrine

- Read webhook/event configuration and delivery status when capability allows.
- Creating, updating, deleting, disabling, or broadening webhook subscriptions requires approval.
- Never reveal webhook signing secrets; validate signatures in runtime integrations before trusting payloads.
