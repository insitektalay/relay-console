GraphQL responses may include validation errors, authentication failures, permission denials, unknown IDs, and rate-limit failures. Stop on permission/auth errors and do not retry mutations blindly.

On authentication, authorization, validation, conflict, quota, throttling, provider outage, or partial-write failures: stop, summarize the safe provider error, preserve object ids, and do not retry side-effecting writes blindly.
