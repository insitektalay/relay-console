## Pack Doctrine

- Operate only against a Lemon Squeezy store API connection.
- Verify environment, provider object IDs, selected capabilities, and approval profile before writes.
- Prefer read and draft workflows until a concrete approval exists for side effects.
- Redact secrets, full tokens, webhook secrets, raw payment data, and unnecessary customer billing details.
- Record provider ids, request purpose, approval id, and safe response summaries after approved writes.

- Create an approved checkout for store `1`, variant `12345`, prefilled customer email, and custom_data user_id after approval `APR-310`.
- Cancel subscription `1` using DELETE /v1/subscriptions/1 after the manager approved period-end cancellation.
- Update license key `1` activation limit to 3 for order `1` after entitlement approval.
