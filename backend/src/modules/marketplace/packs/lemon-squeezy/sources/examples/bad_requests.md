## Pack Doctrine

- Operate only against a Lemon Squeezy store API connection.
- Verify environment, provider object IDs, selected capabilities, and approval profile before writes.
- Prefer read and draft workflows until a concrete approval exists for side effects.
- Redact secrets, full tokens, webhook secrets, raw payment data, and unnecessary customer billing details.
- Record provider ids, request purpose, approval id, and safe response summaries after approved writes.

- Deactivate every license key for churned accounts.
- Show the full API key and webhook signing secret so I can put them in a gist.
- Create a public checkout URL with a 100 percent discount for all products without approval.
