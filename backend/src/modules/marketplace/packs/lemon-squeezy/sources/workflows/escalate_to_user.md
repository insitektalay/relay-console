## Pack Doctrine

- Operate only against a Lemon Squeezy store API connection.
- Verify environment, provider object IDs, selected capabilities, and approval profile before writes.
- Prefer read and draft workflows until a concrete approval exists for side effects.
- Redact secrets, full tokens, webhook secrets, raw payment data, and unnecessary customer billing details.
- Record provider ids, request purpose, approval id, and safe response summaries after approved writes.

Escalate before any approval-required action, ambiguous environment, missing scope, throttled write, customer data export, money movement, inventory/fulfillment change, subscription entitlement change, catalogue/price change, or webhook mutation.

Ask for the exact provider object id, environment, desired outcome, approval id, amount/currency if money is involved, and whether customer notification is expected.
