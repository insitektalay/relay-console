## Failure Modes

- 401/403 means missing token, expired OAuth, missing scope or no access to the site.
- 404 can mean an id is wrong or the token does not cover that site/collection/item.
- 409/400 can occur when CMS field slugs/types or required fields are invalid.

## Response Discipline

- Stop on auth, permission or ownership failures and ask for corrected access.
- Do not retry destructive or publishing calls blindly.
- Record provider error code/status and redacted request target in the audit summary.
