## Provider Events

- Webflow webhooks are scoped to sites and trigger types such as form submissions, site publish and collection item changes where supported.
- Webhook handlers must verify source, dedupe retries and keep endpoint secrets out of generated docs.

## Safety Rules

- Creating, changing or deleting webhook subscriptions requires approval.
- Validate signatures/secrets where the provider supports them.
- Redact webhook URLs, signing secrets and delivery payload secrets.
- Dedupe retries and avoid sending private payloads to unapproved external destinations.
