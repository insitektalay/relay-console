## Pack Doctrine

- Operate only against a Shopify shop Admin API connection.
- Verify environment, provider object IDs, selected capabilities, and approval profile before writes.
- Prefer read and draft workflows until a concrete approval exists for side effects.
- Redact secrets, full tokens, webhook secrets, raw payment data, and unnecessary customer billing details.
- Record provider ids, request purpose, approval id, and safe response summaries after approved writes.

- Summarize products with status DRAFT or ACTIVE and variants with inventory below 5 for shop `acme.myshopify.com`.
- Read order `gid://shopify/Order/450789469` with fulfillments, refunds, returns, and customer contact fields redacted.
- Check the GraphQL cost for this products query and suggest a smaller page size if it would throttle.
