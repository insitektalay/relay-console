## Pack Doctrine

- Operate only against a Shopify shop Admin API connection.
- Verify environment, provider object IDs, selected capabilities, and approval profile before writes.
- Prefer read and draft workflows until a concrete approval exists for side effects.
- Redact secrets, full tokens, webhook secrets, raw payment data, and unnecessary customer billing details.
- Record provider ids, request purpose, approval id, and safe response summaries after approved writes.

## Object Model

- Shop
- Product
- ProductVariant
- Collection

## Operating Notes

- Production catalogue changes alter storefront buying options.
- Refunds, returns, fulfillment, and restock choices affect money movement, inventory, customer notifications, and accounting.
- Customer/order exports carry protected customer data risk.
