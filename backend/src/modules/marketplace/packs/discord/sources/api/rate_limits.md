## Limits And Quotas

- Discord uses per-route and global HTTP rate limits; parse X-RateLimit-* and Retry-After rather than hard-coding.
- Global bot limit is documented as 50 requests per second, separate from route buckets.
- Gateway sends are limited and Identify calls have concurrency/session-start limits.

## Throttling Behavior

- Honor Retry-After and provider rate-limit headers.
- Batch or narrow reads where official APIs support it.
- Prefer webhooks/events over polling when available.
- Never work around limits by rotating user secrets or bypassing provider policy.
