Handle auth failures, permission denied, not found, validation errors, conflict, rate limit, build/deployment failure, and provider outage errors.

On authentication, authorization, validation, conflict, quota, throttling, provider outage, or partial-write failures: stop, summarize the safe provider error, preserve object ids, and do not retry side-effecting writes blindly.
