## Pack Doctrine

- Operate only against a Paddle sandbox or live account API connection.
- Verify environment, provider object IDs, selected capabilities, and approval profile before writes.
- Prefer read and draft workflows until a concrete approval exists for side effects.
- Redact secrets, full tokens, webhook secrets, raw payment data, and unnecessary customer billing details.
- Record provider ids, request purpose, approval id, and safe response summaries after approved writes.

- Create an approved adjustment refund for transaction `txn_01hv975mbh902hcyb7mks5kt0n`, amount USD 29.00, reason duplicate charge, approval `APR-211`.
- Cancel subscription `sub_01hv9770y40xzc823155s0z4zz` at period end after approval.
- Create a new monthly price for product `pro_01gsz97mq9pa4fkyy0wqenepkz` with approved customer-facing description and tax category.
